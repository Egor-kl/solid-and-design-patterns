# SOLID Principles and Design patterns

![.NET Core](https://github.com/MikhailMasny/solid-and-design-patterns/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

The main idea of the applications (App CLI and App Console) is to compile a list of all design patterns and SOLID principles, and combine them into one solution for simplicity and ease of use, a review of examples and source code. This repository has a convenient navigation for finding the necessary material.

## SOLID Principles

The main SOLID Principles are presented [here](https://github.com/MikhailMasny/solid-and-design-patterns/blob/master/docs/solid-principles.md).

## Design patterns

The main design patterns are presented [here](https://github.com/MikhailMasny/solid-and-design-patterns/blob/master/docs/design-patterns.md).

## Getting Started

When the App Console (or App CLI) launches, the user is presented with a menu with available commands and it becomes possible to select the necessary material to demonstrate the operation of the design pattern or SOLID principle.

### Run

To start the console application, you need to run the command:

```
dotnet [appname].dll
```

To start the CLI application and at the same time get help, you need to run the command:

```
dotnet [appname].dll --help
```
