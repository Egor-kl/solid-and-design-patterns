# Design Patterns

Design Patterns in the object-oriented world is a reusable solution to common software design problems that occur repeatedly in real-world application development. It is a template or description of how to solve problems that can be used in many situations.
 
> "A pattern is a recurring solution to a problem in a context."
 
> "Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice." - **Christopher Alexander**, A Pattern Language.

There are 23 design patterns, also known as Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. The Gang of Four is the authors of the book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". These 23 patterns are grouped into three main categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.
