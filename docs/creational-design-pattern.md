# Creational Design Pattern

These patterns are responsible for the convenient and safe creation of new objects or even entire families of objects.

## 1. **Factory Method**

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## 2. **Abstract Factory**

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## 3. **Builder**

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## 4. **Prototype**

Specify the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

## 5. **Singleton**

Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
